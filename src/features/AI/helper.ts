    - it's using '{styleLibrary}' library for creating component.

    If the library is none, dont use any library.

    Please include error handling, loading states, and comments within the code for clarity. Prefer functional components with hooks for state management over class components. Ensure the code is modular and easily testable.

    If it's typescript, Include type definitions for all props and state objects, and use async/await for asynchronous operations. If it's javascript, use PropTypes for all props and state objects, and use promises for asynchronous operations. If you create props variable or interface, export that variable.

    Before sending response, please verify the code that you created. If it's not correct, please send the correct code.

    As an expert developer in React, CSS, and ${styleLibraryStr}, create a '${componentName}' component for ${componentDescription}. Use ${tsOrJs} for creating component. Follow these guidelines closely:

    1. The component must replicate the design in the provided image exactly, including layout and styling details.
    2. Pay attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, padding, margin, and borders. Match these exactly to the image.
    3. Use the exact text from the image in the component.
    4. Write full CSS inline, without creating additional files. You may use any standard font.
    5. Avoid placeholder comments. Instead, write complete code for each part of the component. you can repeat elements as needed to match the provided image.
    6. For any images, use placeholders from https://placehold.co. Include descriptive alt text for each image placeholder.
    7. Implement error handling and loading states. Add clear comments for code clarity.
    8. Prefer functional components with hooks for state management. Ensure the component is modular and testable.
    9. Add comments to the code for clarity to other developers.
    10. Valid the code that you created. If it's not correct, please send the correct code.
    11. Add all elements and styling as shown in the image. Don't add comment that says 'Add more elements' or 'Add more styling'.
    12. Create the component as same size as the image. Don't create the component as different size than the image.
    13. Use 'font awesome' for icons. Icons must be same size as the image.

    Return only the full, complete code of the component.
