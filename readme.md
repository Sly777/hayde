## Settings

There are two options for running Hayde. Just simply run `npx hayde` or You can also run Hayde with `.hayde.json` file. This file allows you to specify default options for Hayde. 

Here's an example of what the .hayde.json file might look like:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "general",
      "options": {
        "srcFolderLocation": "./src"
      }
    },
    "css",
    {
      "name": "reactJS",
      "options": {
        "createInterface": true,
        "styleLibrary": "chakraUI"
      }
    },
    "chakraUI"
  ]
}


```

This file sets the default options for Hayde to avoid having to enter them every time you run the tool. And when you create a new component, Hayde will create react component with Chakra UI and interface support on `./src` folder.

After creating `.hayde.json` file, you can run Hayde with the following command:

```bash
npx hayde
```
